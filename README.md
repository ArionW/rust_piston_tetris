# rust_piston_tetris
My implementation of tetris using rust land and Piston Game engine.

To run sample just clone repository and run cargo run in the root folder

Tried to make it fully configable so config.csv is way to go if you would like to change colors or size.
There is however no try catch parse, so if you input not valid value you are gonna get panic!
